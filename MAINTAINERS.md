# Maintainers of the SLSA Specification

Maintainers are [responsible][SLSA Governance] for day-to-day operation of the
project. Every pull request in this repository must be approved by
at least one Maintainer, as per [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

This file contains the canonical list of SLSA Specification Maintainers. It is
manually mirrored to the [Specification Maintainers] GitHub team, which confers
permissions in this repository.

### Becoming a Maintainer

The criteria for becoming a Maintainer is documented in the [SLSA Governance]
repository and copied here for convenience:

-   Demonstrated track record of PR reviews (both quality and quantity of reviews)
-   Demonstrated thought leadership in the project
-   Demonstrated shepherding of project work and contributors

The best way to get started is to regularly contribute and review pull requests.

To nominate a candidate, send a PR adding the candidate's name to the list of
[Current Maintainers]. If the candidate is not the author, have the candidate
approve the PR as well.

Once the PR is approved and merged, an existing Maintainer will [add] the
candidate to the [Specification Maintainers] GitHub team.

### Removing a Maintainer

The criteria for removing a Maintainer is documented in the [SLSA Governance]
repository.

To remove Maintainer, send a PR to move the candidate from [Current Maintainers]
to [Retired Maintainers]. If the candidate is not the author, request review
from the candidate to inform them of their removal. Approval from the candidate
is *not* required, though it is desirable.

Once the PR is approved and merged, a Maintainer will [remove] the person from
the [Specification Maintainers] GitHub team.
